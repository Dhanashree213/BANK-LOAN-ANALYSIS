# BANK-LOAN-ANALYSIS
This is Bank loan of Customers project where we were provided with 2 datasets with .csv extension files having 39k rows each and the objective was to analyze the growth that bank got within given years in loans. I prepared dashboard using MS Excel, Tableau and PowerBI tools where I prepared interactive dashboards.

## Insights based on KPI'S
1. Year-wise Loan Amount Statistics:
The first KPI focuses on the year-wise loan amount statistics. This analysis is crucial as it provides a clear view of how our lending portfolio has evolved over time. By examining the loan amounts year by year, we can identify trends, such as periods of growth, stability, or decline.

- Insight: Over the years, we may observe a consistent increase in loan amounts, which could indicate a growing customer base or an increase in average loan size. Alternatively, if there's a decline in certain years, it might suggest economic downturns, stricter lending criteria, or shifts in market demand.

2. Grade and Sub-grade Wise Revolving Balance (Revol_Bal):
The second KPI focuses on the revolving balance categorized by grade and sub-grade. This is important for assessing the creditworthiness of our borrowers and understanding the risk distribution across different credit grades.

- Insight: By analyzing revol_bal across grades and sub-grades, we can identify which segments of our portfolio are contributing the most to our outstanding balances. For example, if higher-grade borrowers (e.g., Grade A) maintain lower revolving balances, it indicates lower risk, while lower-grade borrowers (e.g., Grade D or E) might have higher balances, suggesting higher risk.

3. Total Payment for Verified Status vs. Non-Verified Status:
Our third KPI compares the total payments received from verified and non-verified borrowers. This is a critical measure of the effectiveness of our verification processes and the impact on payment reliability.

- Insight: If verified borrowers are consistently making higher total payments compared to non-verified ones, it reinforces the importance of our verification processes in ensuring borrower reliability. On the other hand, if non-verified borrowers are performing well, it may indicate that our current criteria for verification might be too stringent.

4. State-wise and Month-wise Loan Status:
This KPI examines loan status distribution across different states and months. It helps us understand geographic and temporal patterns in loan performance.

- Insight: By mapping loan status (e.g., current, delinquent, charged-off) across states and months, we can identify regions with higher default rates or months where defaults spike. For example, certain states may consistently show higher delinquency rates, which could be due to local economic conditions, and certain months might exhibit seasonal patterns in defaults.

5. Home Ownership vs. Last Payment Date Statistics:
Finally, the fifth KPI explores the relationship between home ownership and the last payment date. This helps us understand whether home ownership status affects borrowers' ability to meet payment deadlines.

- Insight: If homeowners consistently make payments on time, it suggests that home ownership is a strong indicator of financial stability and reliability. Conversely, if renters or those without property ownership tend to miss payments, it could highlight a higher risk group.

## Conclusion
- In conclusion, these KPIs provide a comprehensive view of our lending operations and borrower behavior. I've been able to uncover key insights that will drive better decision-making and enhance our business strategies. Whether it's understanding year-over-year loan trends, assessing risk through revolving balances, evaluating the effectiveness of our verification processes, or analyzing geographic and temporal loan performance, each of these insights plays a crucial role in shaping our future direction.
